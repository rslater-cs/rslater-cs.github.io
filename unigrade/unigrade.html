        UniGrade is my first Android application. I set out to make an app that would be able to track
         my grade of each assignment in each module and then give me a prediction of what I should get 
         for that module and my final course grade. It taught me the use of material design and SQLite.

    <p class="projectDesc">
        I built my app twice, the full version was made with Java and a smaller version was made with Kotlin for practice with the language. 
        I learnt how to use Android studio along with SQLite which was used for storing course details. The project taught me UI design such as 
        dynamic cards and fluid movement forwards and backwards within the program.
